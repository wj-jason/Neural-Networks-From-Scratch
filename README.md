# Writing a Neural Network from Scratch!

This project will create a neural network from scratch in Python using only NumPy.

First, we will go through all the relavent math as shown in mathematics.md, before translating everything into code under the 'python' directory.

The final model will be trained and tested on make_circles from sklearn.datasets.
